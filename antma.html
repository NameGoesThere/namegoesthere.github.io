    <p>
        Antma is a floating window manager with a focus on organization and simplicity.
        And unlike other floating window managers,
        cluttered windows are not an issue.
        this is due to Antma having an infinitely large desktop
        where windows can be moved around freely (see GIF above).
        <br><br>
        Unfortunately, Antma is far from complete and is not yet open source.
        But you can keep track of development by reaching out to @namegoesthere on discord.
        <br><br>
        Antma will come bundled with some utility programs, which you can find <a href="https://github.com/antma-window-manager">here</a>.
